<h2 align = "center">  🐾 G'day mates, welcome to my hacker den of stray cats 🐈 </h2>

## 🧩 <em> Perks </em>
- 🛠️ Refactoring the universe
- 🧵 Thread-safe but not life-safe
- ⚡ Optimising cache lines
- ☕ Surviving on coffee & dreams :3
- 🌸 Writing bugs poetically (oops XD)
> ***bugs as poetry, or potentially as exploits... who knows?***

---

## 🌌 <em> Lore </em>
- A stray hacker wandering between order and chaos,
- An architect of stray systems, creating yet questioning their essence. 
- A gamer who carries both creation and destruction.
> ***A hacker-philosopher, wandering like an architect of stray systems.***

<p align = "center"><em><strong>
デキる猫は今日も憂鬱 <br>
I’m a proud loner, being an edgerunner .. <br><br>
本当に美しいもののために <br>
死にたいんだ <br>
だって生きているだけで <br>
汚れるから <br>
死ねって気持ちを吞み込んで <br>
内側からズタズタになる <br>
血にまみれたこの魂で何をする? <br><br>
彷徨えるままゆけ <br>
no paradise for <br>
stray souls
</strong></em></p>

> ***Every system has a backdoor, even the one called reality.*** 🐾
