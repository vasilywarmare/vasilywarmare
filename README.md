<h2 align="center">  🐾 G'day mates, welcome to my hacker den of stray cats 🐈 </h2>

## 🧩 Perks
- 🛠️ Refactoring the universe
- 🧵 Thread-safe but not life-safe
- ⚡ Optimising cache lines
- ☕ Surviving on coffee & dreams :3
- 🌸 Writing bugs poetically (oops XD)
> ***bugs as poetry, or potentially as exploits... who knows?***
---

## 🌌 Lore
- A stray hacker wandering between order and chaos,
- An architect of stray systems, creating yet questioning their essence. 
- A gamer who carries both creation and destruction.
> ***A hacker-philosopher, wandering like an architect of stray systems.***

---
> ***Every system has a backdoor, even the one called reality.*** 🐾
